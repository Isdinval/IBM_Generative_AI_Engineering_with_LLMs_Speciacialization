# NLP Data Processing Notebooks

This repository contains two notebooks that focus on key aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP): creating a custom data loader and implementing tokenization. These notebooks provide step-by-step explanations and code implementations to facilitate NLP data preprocessing.

## üìå Notebooks Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating an NLP Data Loader** (`Creating an NLP Data Loader.ipynb`)
This notebook demonstrates how to build a custom data loader for NLP tasks. It covers the following key aspects:

- **Loading and Preprocessing Text Data**: Reads text data from various sources (CSV, JSON, or raw text) and applies preprocessing techniques.
- **Dataset Structuring**: Organizes data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Batching and Padding**: Implements batching techniques to handle variable-length sequences efficiently.
- **Custom DataLoader Implementation**: Uses PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes to efficiently load and batch data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explores how to speed up data loading using multiprocessing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implementing Tokenization** (`Implementing Tokenization.pdf`)
This document provides an in-depth exploration of tokenization techniques in NLP. It covers:

- **Types of Tokenization**:
  - Word-level tokenization
  - Subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, WordPiece)
  - Character-level tokenization
- **Comparative Analysis**: Discusses the trade-offs between different tokenization approaches.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Using standard libraries like `NLTK`, `spaCy`, and `Hugging Face Tokenizers`
  - Custom tokenization strategies for specialized NLP tasks
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Strategies for dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and special characters.
- **Efficiency Considerations**: Memory and processing optimizations for large-scale text data.

## üîó Additional Notes
- These notebooks can be used independently, but together they form a strong foundation for NLP preprocessing.
- Future extensions may include advanced text augmentation techniques and tokenization benchmarking.
